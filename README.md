  <h1>Mobile Phone Price & Feature Analysis</h1>

  <p>
    This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cross-country price comparison on mobile phones launched from different brands, models, and years. It provides insights into device specifications, pricing strategies across five countries, and feature trends for the global smartphone market.
  </p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Source:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile phone dataset including company, model, specifications, and launch prices in Pakistan, India, China, USA, and Dubai.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Main Steps:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Load and inspect the mobile phone dataset.</li>
        <li>Data cleaning and transformation (e.g., standardizing price formats and numerical conversions).</li>
        <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on features such as RAM, camera quality, processor, battery capacity, and screen size.</li>
        <li>Visualization of price distributions and comparisons across brands, countries, years, and major specs using matplotlib.</li>
        <li>Identification of market trends, feature popularity, company dominance, and price fluctuations year-over-year.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notable Code Sections</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Specification and Price Analysis:</strong>  
      Compared phone specs (RAM, cameras, processors, battery, screen size) and their influence on launch prices.  
      Analyzed price differences for same/similar models across countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Brand and Launch Year Trends:</strong>  
      Assessed leading brands and their flagship models, pricing strategies, and release schedules.  
      Visualized shifts in popular features and price points over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Python 3.8 or later</li>
    <li>pandas, matplotlib</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository.</li>
    <li>Open <code>mobile.ipynb</code> in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.</li>
    <li>Ensure all dependencies are installed (see Requirements).</li>
    <li>Run each notebook cell to reproduce EDA, visualization, and insights.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Presents an interactive and visual analysis of the global mobile phone market for 2021â€“2024.</li>
    <li>Reveals trends in specifications (e.g., increasing RAM, camera quality, battery capacity).</li>
    <li>Compares price movements and feature adoption by brand and geography.</li>
    <li>Highlights strategic pricing of flagship models across regions.</li>
  </ul>
